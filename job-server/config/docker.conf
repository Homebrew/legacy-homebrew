    # If you wish to pass any settings directly to the sparkConf as-is, add them here in passthrough,
    # such as hadoop connection settings that don't use the "spark." prefix
    passthrough {
      #es.nodes = "192.1.1.1"

  # This needs to match SPARK_HOME for cluster SparkContexts to be created successfully
  home = "/usr/local/spark"
}

# Note that you can use this file to define settings not only for job server,
# but for your Spark jobs as well.  Spark job configuration merges with this configuration file as defaults.
