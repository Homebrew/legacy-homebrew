.SH "NAME"
\fBbrew\fR \- The missing package manager for OS X
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.
.br
\fBbrew\fR [\-\-version|\-v]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Homebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple didn\'t include with OS X\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR command [options] [formula] \.\.\.
Prints extra, command\-specific debugging information\. Note that \fBbrew \-v\fR by itself is the same as \fBbrew \-\-version\fR\.
.
.SH "ESSENTIAL COMMANDS"
For the full command list, see the COMMANDS section\.
.
.TP
\fBinstall\fR \fIformula\fR
Install \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBremove\fR \fIformula\fR
Uninstall \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBupdate\fR
Fetch the newest version of Homebrew from GitHub using \fBgit\fR(1)\.
.
.TP
\fBlist\fR
List all installed formulae\.
.
.TP
\fBsearch\fR, \fB\-S\fR \fItext\fR|/\fItext\fR/
Perform a substring search of formula names for \fItext\fR\. If \fItext\fR is surrounded with slashes, then it is interpreted as a regular expression\. If no search term is given, all available formula are displayed\.
.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.
.TP
\fBaudit [\-\-strict]\fR [\fIformulae\fR]
Check \fIformulae\fR for Homebrew coding style violations\. This should be run before submitting a new formula\.
.
.IP
If no \fIformulae\fR are provided, all of them are checked\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-strict\fR is passed, perform additional stricter checks that may not need to be fixed before submitting\.
.
.IP
\fBaudit\fR exits with a non\-zero status if any errors are found\. This is useful, for instance, for implementing pre\-commit hooks\.
.
.TP
\fBcat\fR \fIformula\fR
Display the source to \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBcleanup [\-\-force]\fR [\fIformula\fR]
For all installed or specific formulae, remove any older versions from the cellar\. By default, does not remove out\-of\-date keg\-only brews, as other software may link directly to specific versions\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-force\fR is passed, remove out\-of\-date keg\-only brews as well\.
.
.TP
\fBcreate [\-\-autotools|\-\-cmake] [\-\-no\-fetch]\fR \fIURL\fR
Generate a formula for the downloadable file at \fIURL\fR and open it in $EDITOR\. Homebrew will attempt to automatically derive the formula name and version, but if it fails, you\'ll have to make your own template\. The wget formula serves as a simple example\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-autotools\fR is passed, create a basic template for an Autotools\-style build\. If \fB\-\-cmake\fR is passed, create a basic template for a CMake\-style build\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-no\-fetch\fR is passed, Homebrew will not download \fIURL\fR to the cache and will thus not add the MD5 to the formula for you\.
.
.TP
\fBdeps [\-\-1] [\-n] [\-\-all]\fR \fIformula\fR
Show \fIformula\fR\'s dependencies\.
.
.IP

.
.IP
If \fB\-n\fR is passed, show dependencies in topological order\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-all\fR is passed, show dependencies for all formulae\.
.
.TP
\fBdiy [\-\-set\-name] [\-\-set\-version]\fR
Automatically determine the installation prefix for non\-Homebrew software\.
.
.IP
Using the output from this command, you can install your own software into the Cellar and then link it into Homebrew\'s prefix with \fBbrew link\fR\.
.
.IP
The options \fB\-\-set\-name\fR and \fB\-\-set\-version\fR each take an argument and allow you to explicitly set the name and version of the package you are installing\.
.
.TP
\fBdoctor\fR

Open \fIformula\fR in $EDITOR\.
.
.TP
\fBfetch [\-\-force] [\-v] [\-\-HEAD] [\-\-deps]\fR \fIformulae\fR
Download the source packages for the given \fIformulae\fR\. For tarballs, also print MD5 and SHA1 checksums\.

.IP
If \fB\-\-HEAD\fR is passed, download the HEAD versions of \fIformulae\fR instead\. \fB\-v\fR may also be passed to make the VCS checkout verbose, useful for seeing if an existing HEAD cache has been updated\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-force\fR is passed, remove a previously cached version and re\-fetch\.
.

.
.TP
\fBln\fR, \fBlink\fR \fIformula\fR
Symlink all of \fIformula\fR\'s installed files into the Homebrew prefix\. This is done automatically when you install formula, but can be useful for DIY installations\.

.SH "EXTERNAL COMMANDS"
Homebrew, like \fBgit\fR(1), supports external commands\. These are executable scripts that reside somewhere in the PATH, named \fBbrew\-<cmdname>\fR or \fBbrew\-<cmdname>\.rb\fR, which can be invoked like \fBbrew cmdname\fR\. This allows you to create your own commands without modifying Homebrew\'s internals\.
.
.P
A number of (useful, but unsupported) example commands are included and enabled by default:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

$ ls `brew \-\-repository`/Library/Contributions/examples
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Documentation for the included external commands as well as instructions for creating your own can be found on the wiki: \fIhttp://wiki\.github\.com/mxcl/homebrew/External\-Commands\fR
.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE
If set, instructs Homebrew to compile from source even when a formula provides a bottle\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_CACHE
If set, instructs Homebrew to use the give folder as the download cache\. Otherwise, \fB~/Library/Caches/Homebrew\fR is used\.
.
.IP
This can be used to keep downloads out of your home folder, if you have it mounted on an SSD or are using FileVault for instance\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_DEBUG
If set, instructs Homebrew to always assume \fB\-\-debug\fR when running commands\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_DEBUG_INSTALL
When \fBbrew install \-d\fR or \fBbrew install \-i\fR drops into a shell, \fBHOMEBREW_DEBUG_INSTALL\fR will be set to the name of the formula being brewed\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_DEBUG_PREFIX
When \fBbrew install \-d\fR or \fBbrew install \-i\fR drops into a shell, \fBHOMEBREW_DEBUG_PREFIX\fR will be set to the target prefix in the Cellar of the formula being brewed\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_EDITOR
If set, Homebrew will use this editor when editing a single formula, or several formulae in the same folder\.
.
.IP
\fINOTE\fR: \fBbrew edit\fR will open all of Homebrew as discontinuous files and folders\. TextMate can handle this correctly in project mode, but many editors will do strange things in this case\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_KEEP_INFO
If set, Homebrew will not remove files from \fBshare/info\fR, allowing them to be linked from the Cellar\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_MAKE_JOBS
If set, instructs Homebrew to use the value of \fBHOMEBREW_MAKE_JOBS\fR as the number of parallel jobs to run when building with \fBmake\fR(1)\.
.
.IP
\fIDefault:\fR the number of available CPU cores\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_SVN
When exporting from Subversion, Homebrew will use \fBHOMEBREW_SVN\fR if set, a Homebrew\-built Subversion if installed, or the system\-provided binary\.
.
.IP
Set this to force Homebrew to use a particular svn binary\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_TEMP
If set, instructs Homebrew to use \fBHOMEBREW_TEMP\fR as the temporary folder for building packages\. This may be needed if your system temp folder and Homebrew Prefix are on different volumes, as OS X has trouble moving symlinks across volumes when the target does not yet exist\.
.
.IP
This issue typically occurs when using FileVault or custom SSD configurations\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_USE_CLANG
If set, instructs Homebrew to compile using clang\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_USE_GCC
If set, instructs Homebrew to compile using gcc\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_USE_LLVM
If set, instructs Homebrew to compile using LLVM\.
.
.IP
\fINOTE\fR: Not all formulae build correctly with LLVM\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_VERBOSE
If set, instructs Homebrew to always assume \fB\-\-verbose\fR when running commands\.
.
.SH "USING HOMEBREW BEHIND A PROXY"
Homebrew uses several commands for downloading files (e\.g\. curl, git, svn)\. Many of these tools can download via a proxy\. It\'s common for these tools to read proxy parameters from environment variables\.
.
.P
For the majority of cases setting \fBhttp_proxy\fR is enough\. You can set this in your shell profile, or you can use it before a brew command:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

http_proxy=http://<host>:<port> brew install foo
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
If your proxy requires authentication:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

http_proxy=http://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port> brew install foo
.
