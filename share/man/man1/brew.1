.SH "NAME"
\fBbrew\fR \- The missing package manager for OS X
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBbrew\fR [\-\-verbose|\-v] command [options] [formula] \.\.\.
.
.br
\fBbrew\fR [\-\-version|\-v]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Homebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple didn\'t include with OS X\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR command [options] [formula] \.\.\.
Prints extra, comand\-specific debugging information\. Note that \fBbrew \-v\fR by itself is the same as \fBbrew \-\-version\fR\.
.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print the version number of brew to standard error and exit\.
.
.TP
\fBinstall [\-\-force] [\-\-debug] [\-\-use\-llvm] [\-\-ignore\-dependencies] [\-\-HEAD]\fR \fIformula\fR
Install \fIformula\fR\.
.
.IP
\fIformula\fR is usually the name of the formula to install, but may also be the URL for an arbitrary formula\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-force\fR is passed, will install \fIformula\fR even if it is already installed\. This can be used to re\-install a formula without removing it first\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-debug\fR is passed and brewing fails, open a shell inside the temporary folder used for compiling\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-use\-llvm\fR is passed, attempt to compile using the LLVM front\-end to GCC\. \fINOTE\fR: Not all formulae will build with LLVM\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-ignore\-dependencies\fR is passed, skip installing any dependencies of any kind\. If they are not already present, the formula will probably fail to install\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-HEAD\fR is passed, and \fIformula\fR defines it, install the HEAD version, aka master, trunk, unstable, dev\.
.
.IP
To install a newer version of HEAD use \fBbrew rm <foo> && brew install \-\-HEAD <foo>\fR or \fBbrew \-\-force \-\-HEAD <foo>\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBinstall \-\-interactive [\-\-git]\fR \fIformula\fR
Download and patch \fIformula\fR, then open a shell\. This allows the user to run \fB\./configure \-\-help\fR and otherwise determine how to turn the software package into a Homebrew formula\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-git\fR is passed, Homebrew will create a Git repository, useful for creating patches to the software\.
.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fBsearch\fR \fItext\fR|/\fItext\fR/
Perform a substring search of formula names for \fItext\fR\. If \fItext\fR is surrounded with slashes, then it is interpreted as a regular expression\. If no search term is given, all available formula are displayed\.
.
.TP
\fB\-S \-\-macports\fR|\fB\-\-fink\fR \fItext\fR
Search for \fItext\fR on the MacPorts or Fink package search page\.
.
.TP
\fBupdate\fR
Fetch the newest version of Homebrew from GitHub using \fBgit\fR(1)\.
.
.TP
\fBlist\fR

.
.TP
\fBlist\fR \fIformula\fR
List the installed files for \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBinfo\fR \fIformula\fR
Display information about \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBinfo \-\-github\fR \fIformula\fR
Open a browser to the GitHub History page for formula \fIformula\fR\.
.
.IP
To view formula history locally: \fBbrew log \-p <formula>\fR\.

\fBrm\fR, \fBremove\fR, \fBuninstall [\-\-force]\fR \fIformula\fR
Uninstall \fIformula\fR\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-force\fR is passed, and there are multiple versions of \fIformula\fR installed, delete all installed versions\.
.
.TP
\fBcreate [\-\-cache]\fR \fIURL\fR
Generate a formula for the downloadable file at \fIURL\fR and opens it in $EDITOR\. Homebrew will attempt to automatically derive the formula name and version, if it fails, you\'ll have to make your own template\. I suggest copying wget\'s\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-cache\fR is passed, Homebrew will download the \fIURL\fR to the cache and add the MD5 to the formula for you\.
.
.TP
\fBedit\fR \fIformula\fR
Open \fIformula\fR in $EDITOR\.
.
.TP
\fBedit\fR
Open all of Homebrew for editing in TextMate\.
.
.TP
\fBln\fR, \fBlink\fR \fIformula\fR

Download the source package for the given \fIformula\fR\. For tarballs, also prints MD5 and SHA1 checksums\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-HEAD\fR is passed, download the HEAD version of \fIformula\fR instead\. \fB\-v\fR may also be passed to make the VCS checkout verbose, useful for seeing if an existing HEAD cache has been updated\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-force\fR is passed, remove a previously cached version and re\-fetch\.
.
.TP
\fBaudit [\-\-warn]\fR
Check formulae for Homebrew coding style violations\. This should be run before submitting a new formula for inclusion\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-warn\fR is passed, perform additional stricter checks that may not need to be fixed before submitting\.
.
.TP
\fBoptions\fR \fIformula\fR
Display install options specific to \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBmissing\fR

.
.TP
\fBtest\fR \fIformula\fR
A few formulae provide a test method\. \fBbrew test <formula>\fR runs this test method\. There is no standard output or return code, but it should generally indicate to the user if something is wrong with the installed formula\.
.
.IP
Example: \fBbrew install jruby && brew test jruby\fR
.
.TP

Display where Homebrew\'s \fB\.git\fR folder is located\. For standard installs, the \fBprefix\fR and \fBrepository\fR are the same folder\.
.
.SH "EXTERNAL COMMANDS"
Homebrew allows external commands to be defined by putting a +x file named \fBbrew\-<cmdname>\fR or \fBbrew\-<cmdname>\.rb\fR on the PATH\. This will cause Homebrew to recognize \fBbrew cmdname\fR\.
.
.P
Some sample commands ship with Homebrew and are enabled by default\.
.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_DEBUG
If set, instructs Homebrew to always assume \fB\-\-debug\fR when running commands\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_DEBUG_INSTALL
When \fBbrew install \-d\fR or \fBbrew install \-i\fR drops into a shell, \fBHOMEBREW_DEBUG_INSTALL\fR will be set to the name of the formula being brewed\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_DEBUG_PREFIX
When \fBbrew install \-d\fR or \fBbrew install \-i\fR drops into a shell, \fBHOMEBREW_DEBUG_PREFIX\fR will be set to the target prefix in the Cellar of the formula being brewed\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_EDITOR
If set, Homebrew will use this editor when editing a single formula, or several formulae in the same folder\.
.
.IP
\fINOTE\fR: \fBbrew edit\fR will open all of Homebrew as discontinuous files and folders\. TextMate can handle this correctly in project mode, but many editors will do strange things in this case\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_KEEP_INFO
If set, Homebrew will not remove files from \fBshare/info\fR, allowing them to be linked from the Cellar\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_SVN
When exporting from Subversion, Homebrew will use \fBHOMEBREW_SVN\fR if set, a Homebrew\-built Subversion if installed, or the system\-provided binary\.
.
.IP
Set this to force Homebrew to use a particular svn binary\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_TEMP
If set, instructs Homebrew to use \fBHOMEBREW_TEMP\fR as the temporary folder for building packages\. This may be needed if your system temp folder and Homebrew Prefix are on different volumes, as OS X has trouble moving symlinks across volumes when the target does not yet exist\.
.
.IP
This issue typically occurs when using FileVault or custom SSD configurations\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_USE_LLVM
If set, instructs Homebrew to use the LLVM front\-ends to the GCC compilers\.
.
.IP
\fINOTE\fR: Not all formulae build correctly with LLVM\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_VERBOSE
If set, instructs Homebrew to always assume \fB\-\-verbose\fR when running commands\.
.
.SH "USING HOMEBREW BEHIND A PROXY"
Homebrew uses several commands for downloading files (e\.g\. curl, git, svn)\. Many of these tools can download via a proxy\. It\'s common for these tools to read proxy parameters from environment variables\.
.
.P
For the majority of cases setting \fBhttp_proxy\fR is enough\. You can set this in your shell profile, or you can use it before a brew command:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

http_proxy=http://<host>:<port> brew install foo
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
If your proxy requires authentication:
