# README
Homebrew installs the stuff you need that Apple didn’t.

- [Install Homebrew](Installation.md)
- [Frequently Asked Questions](FAQ.md)
- [Tips and Tricks](Tips-N'-Tricks.md)
- [Gems, Eggs and Perl Modules](Gems,-Eggs-and-Perl-Modules.md)
- [Homebrew and Python](Homebrew-and-Python.md)

Please note: Homebrew is not 1.0 yet. Generally it works well, but when
it doesn’t we’d hope you report the bug.
## Troubleshooting
First, please run `brew update` (twice) and `brew doctor`.

Second, please read the [Troubleshooting Checklist](Troubleshooting.md).

**If you don’t follow these steps it will take us far longer to help you with
your problem.**

However! Fixing build issues is easier than you think: try
`brew edit $FORMULA` and see how you fare.
