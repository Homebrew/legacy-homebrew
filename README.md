Homebrew
========
Homebrew helps you install the UNIX tools that didn't come with OS X.


Quick Install
-------------
Install [Xcode][xcode] and then run this script: <http://gist.github.com/323731>

If you want to install Homebrew somewhere other than /usr/local see the
[installation instructions][install].


Look dude, I know what I'm doing!
---------------------------------
Alright then… as long as you're sure:

    cd /usr/local
    sudo chown -R $USER .
    curl -Lsf http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1
