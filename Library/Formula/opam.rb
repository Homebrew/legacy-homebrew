    OPAM uses ~/.opam by default for its package database, so you need to
    initialize it first by running (as a normal user):

    $  opam init

    Run the following to initialize your environment variables:

    $  eval `opam config env`

    To export the needed variables every time, add them to your dotfiles.
      * On Bash, add them to `~/.bash_profile`.
      * On Zsh, add them to `~/.zprofile` instead.

    Documentation and tutorials are available at http://opam.ocamlpro.com, or
    via 'man opam' and 'opam --help'.
