    MySQL is required to install.

    You can install this with Homebrew using:
      brew install mysql

    If you plan to install mysql-odbc-connector as universal (32- and 64-bit),
    install MySQL using:
      brew install mysql --universal

    Or, you can use an official installer from:
      http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
    EOS
