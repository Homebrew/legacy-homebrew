#Scala #akka @ApacheSpark

* Spark streaming context support !!  (@zeitos)
* Change `server_start.sh` to use `spark-submit`.  This should fix some edge case bugs.
* Configurable driver memory (@acidghost)
* Be able to accept environment vars in job server config files, eg `master = ${?MY_SPARK_HOST}`   (see the [Typesafe Config docs](https://github.com/typesafehub/config#uses-of-substitutions))
